# Fall2024-CSC413-Project
The entire code used to process and augment the dataset, train the model, save the model state, save the model's prediction on the test set, and plot the train and val loss is in the cloud_detection.ipynb file. Other files (Python files) were initially used for development but we eventually decided to write all of our code to the cloud_detection.ipynb file so that we can run our code on Kaggle. Hence, it is important to note that our code cloud_detection.ipynb works with the input and output directories of Kaggle to load the dataset from Kaggle and save the outputs to Kaggle as well. Thus, the cloud_detection.ipynb file cannot be directly run on Google Colab.
